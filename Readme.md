An API interface for the [W3Champions](https://w3champions.com) battle platform in python,
and a Twitch bot implementation.


Run the bot with bot.py.

If you're missing the 'twitch.ini' config file/required keys, It will be generated for you, but mostly you will probably dockerize this. Just be sure to include in the dockerfile to copy a 'twitch.ini' secrets file into the root of this project.
